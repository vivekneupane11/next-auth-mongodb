- We can rotate token with google signin in jwt callback
- If we want to rotate jwt token we cannot use middleware
   - middleware only runs on edge so 
        - we cannot use middleware if we refresh token as we cannot call
            - getServerSession, getSession, useSession from there
   - And also because getToken() doesn't run jwt callback
   -Only  getSession, useSession, getServerSession can call the next auth callback


So ***Yes*** you can rotate token
But don't use middleware and protect each individual routes
